# House-Price-Prediction
The dataset includes detailed information on housing features such as architectural style, zoning, lot dimensions, neighborhood, condition, and sale details. The goal is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and predictive modeling to understand housing price trends and build accurate valuation models.

**Objectives**

Understand the structure and semantics of the housing dataset.

Perform data cleaning, preprocessing, and feature transformation.

Conduct exploratory data analysis to uncover patterns and correlations.

Build regression models to predict house prices.

Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics.

Interpret feature importance to identify key drivers of home value.
