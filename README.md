# House-Price-Prediction
The dataset includes detailed information on housing features such as architectural style, zoning, lot dimensions, neighborhood, condition, and sale details. The goal is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and predictive modeling to understand housing price trends and build accurate valuation models.

**Objectives**

Understand the structure and semantics of the housing dataset.

Perform data cleaning, preprocessing, and feature transformation.

Conduct exploratory data analysis to uncover patterns and correlations.

Build regression models to predict house prices.

Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics.

Interpret feature importance to identify key drivers of home value.

**Dataset Description**

The dataset contains over 80 variables describing residential properties. Key categories include:

Structural Features: MSSubClass, HouseStyle, BldgType, OverallQual, YearBuilt

Location & Zoning: Neighborhood, MSZoning, LotConfig, LandContour

Lot & Exterior: LotArea, LotFrontage, Exterior1st, RoofStyle, Foundation

Interior & Amenities: GrLivArea, BedroomAbvGr, KitchenQual, FireplaceQu, GarageType

Basement & Utilities: TotalBsmtSF, BsmtQual, HeatingQC, CentralAir

Sale Information: SaleType, SaleCondition, YrSold, MoSold

**Tools & Technologies**

Languages: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, XGBoost

Techniques: EDA, Feature Engineering, Regression Modeling, Cross-Validation

**Modeling Approach**

Regression: Baseline model for interpretability

Evaluation Metrics: RMSE, MAE, RÂ² Score

**Key Insights**

Neighborhood and OverallQual are strong predictors of sale price.

LotArea, GrLivArea, and GarageArea show positive correlation with price.

YearBuilt and RemodAdd reflect modernization impact on valuation.

Categorical features like MSZoning and SaleCondition influence pricing trends.

**Future Enhancements**

Incorporate geospatial analysis using property coordinates.

Apply advanced feature selection and dimensionality reduction.

Deploy model as a web app for interactive price prediction.
